Arduino -> ThingSpeak Data Logger

I'm learning C++. Things may or may not be correct. Use at your own risk!

arduino_data_loger is a datalogger based on an Arduino Uno with data sent to ThingSpeak for reporting / analysis.

# Libraries required for this project;

DHT, OneWire, Wire, Ethernet, EthernetUdp, Dns, ThingSpeak, DallasTemperature, DS3232RTC.

I am not claiming this work as soley mine. Portions of code have been taken from the Arduino website and others.
