Arduino -> ThingSpeak Data Logger

I'm learning C++. Things may or may not be correct.

This is a datalogger based on an Arduino Uno with data sent to ThingSpeak for reporting / analysis.

I am not claiming this work as soley mine. Portions of code have been taken from the Arduino website and others.
